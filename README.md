## Future work

Datetime Filtering and Date Visualization:

I aim to introduce a datetime filtering feature, allowing users to selectively visualize data based on specific date ranges. This enhancement will provide users with a more focused view of their financial data, enabling them to analyze trends and patterns more effectively.

Dynamic Currency Conversion:

Another planned functionality is the addition of dynamic currency conversion. Currently, the application supports Czech Crowns as the default currency. However, I plan to implement a feature that will enable users to switch between different currencies, enhancing its global usability and making it adaptable to various financial contexts.
